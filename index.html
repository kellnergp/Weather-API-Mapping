    <p>
      The purpose of this project was to explore the use of APIs to gather data via the use of Python Libraries.
      It focused on using the OpenWeatherMap and Google Places APIs to gather meteorological and locational data of a representative
      sample of cities from around the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first section, entitled WeatherPy, used a series of API calls to OpenWeatherMap to gather data on the peak temperature, 
      humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed of a random selection of cities worldwide and attempt to determine any correlation 
      between any of those 4 factors and city latitude.  The only discernable trend discovered was that max daily temperature
      correlates strongly with closeness to the equator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second section, VacationPy, used calls to the Google Places APIs to select out cities from the previous list which had 
      hotels within a certain range of the city's coordinates that fit a set of weather criteria and create a marker layer for a 
      gmaps figure.
